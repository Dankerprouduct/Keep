Sometimes a user will remove a printer from a Raptor Kiosk and switch it out for another. In doing so the user then obverves that the printer "doesn't work" or "isnt printer". This is because they do not go into Raptor's Hardware Service to clear out the old printer and set the new one for use with default printing. 

This program checks when a printer is disconnected and removes it from the host machine then refreshes the hardware kiosks making it so that the newly connected printer is now the default printer.
